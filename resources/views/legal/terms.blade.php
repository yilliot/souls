<h1>Terms of Use</h1> 

<h3>Our Commitment</h3>
<p>Circle @ Collective is committed to protecting the privacy of members living in communities where Circle @ Collective works.</p>

<h3>Tracking your use</h3>
<p>We collect statistics on visitor traffic to our website through “cookies”. These are anonymous and do not identify you. We may also anonymously track your visit to our website by using information collected by others. For example, we use Google Analytics Demographics, which tells us things like gender, age range and interests of site visitors – without giving us any information that could be used to identify you. This enables us to better understand how our website is used and what you are interested in.</p>

<p>If you prefer not to allow this, you may be able to adjust your browser to turn off the use of “cookies” or notify you when they are being used. You can also opt out of programmes like Google Analytics if you wish (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). However, if you disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas to take advantage of certain features on our website.</p>

<p>Our website includes references to other people and organisations and links to other websites. Other sites may also have links to our website. You connect with those people and organisations at your own risk. Where we provide a link to another site, we are inviting you to explore it for yourself. This is not an endorsement of individuals, views, businesses, products or services advertised on that site. We encourage you to review each website’s privacy policy, especially if you intend to disclose any personal information via that site.</p>
